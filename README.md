Abasyn is being developed to replicate Firebird-powered databases used by in-house accounting application called Abacus.

It listens to the configured database event which is sent from the server when some data is ready for replication. Upon receiving the event, Abasyn pulls the data from the database and sends to the databases-receivers. Once completed, it cleans up the temporary tables and waits until next event. Also it provides some simple REST API to manage the replication service.
